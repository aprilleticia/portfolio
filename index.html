<h1>April Simpson</h1>

<h2>Hello and welcome. My name is April and I'm a journalist.</h2>

<p>I once spent 72 hours on a train between Lusaka, Zambia and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. During the course of the journey, I endured the humidity, the noisiness of the locomotive, the "bathrooms" that must have been a violation of human rights, smelly feet and aggressive hawkers. I also indulged in delicious tiny bananas, playful children, pretty sunsets, striking views of Tanzania's Great Rift Valley, and amusing exchanges with locals and foreigners alike.</p>
 
<p>I love to travel for the same reasons I love journalism; I'm led by a curiosity to see, experience and understand people and places, a commitment I credit to my family's move from Yonkers, New York to Homosassa, Florida when I was 11 years old. Journalism became a tool for understanding my community, and it's developed into a profession in which I'm led by a desire for understanding every day.<p>
 
<p>I am associate editor of Current: News for People in Public Media, a Washington, D.C.-area trade publication that covers public broadcasting and nonprofit media. My beat is funding and innovation. Prior to joining Current, I reported from Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on a fellowship from the International Women's Media Foundation and Botswana on a Fulbright fellowship. I honed my online journalism skills as a Web Producer for The Seattle Times, with whose staff I shared the <a href="http://old.seattletimes.com/flatpages/specialreports/lakewoodslayings.html">2010 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting</a>.</p>
 
<p>I earned a Master of Science from the London School of Economics and Political Science and Bachelor of Arts, cum laude, from Smith College.</p>
