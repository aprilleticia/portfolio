<h5>About me</h5>

<p>I once spent 72 hours on a train between Lusaka, Zambia and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. During the course of the journey, I endured the humidity, the noisiness of the locomotive, the "bathrooms" that must have been a violation of human rights, smelly feet and aggressive hawkers. I also indulged in delicious tiny bananas, playful children, pretty sunsets, striking views of Tanzania's Great Rift Valley, and amusing exchanges with locals and foreigners alike.</p>
 
<p>I love to travel for the same reasons I love journalism; I'm led by a curiosity to see, experience and understand people and places, a commitment I credit to my family's move from Yonkers, New York to Homosassa, Florida when I was 11 years old. Journalism became a tool for understanding my community, and it's developed into a profession whose application I also seek to understand around the world.</p>
 
<p>I am associate editor of Current: News for People in Public Media, a Washington, D.C.-area trade publication that covers public broadcasting and nonprofit media. My beat is funding and innovation; I interview decisionmakers and creative professionals developing new models for fundraising and audience service. I also follow legislative and policy issues and lead and contribute to special engagement projects. CONNECT TO WHAT I DO NOW AND GRAD SCHOOL</p> 
 
<p>I have been published in The Boston Globe, The International Business Times and Tampa Bay Times. In 2014, I reported from Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on a fellowship from the International Women's Media Foundation. I honed my online journalism skills as a Web Producer for The Seattle Times, with whose staff I shared the 2010 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting.</p>
 
<p>In addition to journalism, I am invested in Media and International Development. As a 2010-11 U.S. Fulbright Scholar, I freelanced for U.S. media outlets and taught Media Studies at the University of Botswana, where I researched the development of online news media. Prior to joining Current, I was a staff writer for a global development charity, for whom I traveled to Central America and the Caribbean to report on extreme poverty. I earned my Master of Science from the London School of Economics and Political Science and my Bachelor of Arts, cum laude, from Smith College.</p>
 
<p>As for that backpacking trip, despite the bumps I took along the way, discovering the narrow streets, crystal waters, spices and Muslim influence of my final destination, Stone Town, Zanzibar, was well worth it. I had a ball.</p>
